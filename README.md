Data science portfolio projects

Project (1): Top 1000 IMBD Movies Web Scraping and EDA
 
 This project begins with web scraping the top 1000 movies page from IMBD.com using the Beautiful Soup library. From the top 1000 movies page separate requests were made to the respective movie pages to collect data like the budget, gross earnings, runtime and ratings of a movie. After scraping the data this project continues with Exploratory Data Analysis which includes various different steps like cleaning the data, performing various analysis along with creating meaningful insights.

Project (2): Machine Learning NLP Classification using Scikit Learn

This project uses a set of 50K IMBD Reviews that was collected from IMDB.com to build a NLP machine learning model. The reviews are classified according to both positive and negative sentiments respectively. This dataset was used to build a  classifier model to accurately predict both positive and negative sentiments. Scikit Learn offers many different types of models for supervised learning. One such model available for classification is the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) method which was used for this project.
