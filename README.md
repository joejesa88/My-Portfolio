Data science portfolio projects

Project (1): Top 1000 IMBD Movies Web Scraping and EDA
 
 This project begins with web scraping the top 1000 movies from IMBD.com. From the list of top 1000 movies page we made separate requests to the respective movie pages to collect data like the budget, gross earnings, runtime and rating. After scraping the data this project continues with Exploratory Data Analysis which begins with cleaning the data and performing various analysis along with insights.

Project (2): Machine Learning NLP Classification using Scikit Learn

This project uses a set of 50K IMBD Reviews that has been web scraped from IMDB.com to build a NLP machine learning model. The reviews are classified according to both positive and negative sentiments respectively. This dataset will be utilized to build a  classifier model that will be able to accurately predict both positive and negative sentiments. Scikit Learn offers many different types of models for supervised learning. One such model available for classification is the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) method which are commonly used for for classification, regression and outliers detection.
